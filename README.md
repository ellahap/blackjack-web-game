# You can play this game [here]()!

I created this web game with HTML + CSS + JS to play a standard game of blackjack against a computer dealer.

The game uses JS functionality such as event listeners, DOM manipulation, and object-oriented logic, alongside intuitive UI with custom-drawn elements. 

I made this game as I self-taught myself JavaScript this summer, as a continuation of the blackjack game I made in high school as I was first learning java.  You can play that version [here]().
